# The Komputer Store

This is my submission for the first assignment in the frontend module of the Noroff Accelerate .NET course.

The goal of the assignment is to build a dynamic webpage using "vanilla" JavaScript.

## File Structure
```bash
└───TheKomputerStore
        index.html
        placeholder.png
        README.md
        script.js
        style.css
```
*Note: Functionality of this webpage is hindered on smaller screens (mobile), as some buttons lie on top of eachother. However, since there was no requirement in the assignment regarding the webpage being responsive this has been ignored. Fixing this would be quite easy (however time consuming), using media-queries in css to adapt placement of elements for smaller screens. This can improved in future work.*
